This document provides an overview of the NLP concepts used in our Interactive NLP Demo.

## Tokenization

### What is it?
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens (words, phrases, symbols).

### Why is it important?
Tokenization is the foundation of text analysis - before a computer can analyze text, it needs to understand where one word ends and another begins.

### Thought experiment:
Consider how tokenization might differ between languages. In English, spaces typically separate words, but what about languages like Chinese or Japanese? How might tokenization algorithms need to adapt?

## Stop Words

### What is it?
Stop words are common words (like "the", "is", "and") that are filtered out before processing text.

### Why is it important?
Stop words often add little meaning to the analysis and removing them can improve processing efficiency and focus on more significant words.

### Thought experiment:
Are stop words truly meaningless? Consider contexts where the presence or pattern of stop words might actually convey important information.

## Stemming

### What is it?
Stemming reduces words to their word stem or root form by chopping off the ends of words.

### Why is it important?
Stemming helps group similar words together. For example, "fishing", "fished", and "fisher" all become "fish".

### Thought experiment:
Stemming can sometimes produce non-words (e.g., "university" becomes "univers"). When might the imprecision of stemming be acceptable, and when might it cause problems?

## Lemmatization

### What is it?
Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma) using vocabulary and morphological analysis.

### Why is it important?
Unlike stemming, lemmatization ensures the root word belongs to the language. For example, "better" becomes "good".

### Thought experiment:
Lemmatization requires understanding parts of speech (e.g., "meeting" could be a verb or a noun). How might this contextual ambiguity affect NLP systems?

## Applications of NLP

### Text Classification
Categorizing text into predefined categories (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).

### Named Entity Recognition
Identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories like person names, organizations, locations.

### Machine Translation
Automatically translating text from one language to another.

### Question Answering
Building systems that can automatically answer questions posed in natural language.

### Sentiment Analysis
Determining the emotional tone behind a text (positive, negative, neutral).

## The Future of NLP

### Multimodal Understanding
Combining text analysis with images, audio, and other data types.

### Few-Shot Learning
NLP systems that can learn from just a few examples.

### Ethical Considerations
Addressing bias, privacy concerns, and misuse of NLP technologies.

### Human-Like Understanding
Moving beyond statistical patterns to genuine understanding of language.
