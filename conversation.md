# Code Helper

ðŸ”¥ A Python Streamlit app to assist with coding tasks.

This Streamlit application provides helpful tools and resources for developers.  It's designed to streamline common coding workflows and offer quick access to information.

## Features

* **[List the key features of your app here.  Be specific!  Examples:]**
    * Code snippet generation (e.g., generating boilerplate code for different languages).
    * Syntax highlighting and formatting.
    * Quick access to documentation for popular libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Streamlit).
    * Unit test generation.
    * Interactive code examples.
    * Conversion between different data formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).
    * Regular expression tester.
    * Code search within a project.

* **[Add more features as needed]**

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   Make sure you have Python installed.  It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Installation:**
   Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   # Install any other dependencies your app requires.  For example:
   # pip install numpy pandas requests
   ```

3. **Running the app:**
   Navigate to the directory containing `app.py` and run:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will open the app in your web browser.

## Usage

* **[Provide clear instructions on how to use the app.  Include screenshots if helpful.  Example:]**
    * To generate a code snippet, select the desired language from the dropdown menu and enter your specifications in the text area.  Click the "Generate" button to see the result.
    * To access the documentation for a library, select the library from the list.

* **[Add more usage examples as needed]**
