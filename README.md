## 🚀 Features

- **Text Processing**: Upload text or files for instant NLP analysis
- **Multiple NLP Techniques**: Explore tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization
- **Interactive Visualizations**: See the impact of different NLP operations through intuitive charts
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for students, educators, and professionals learning NLP concepts

## 🧠 Why Natural Language Processing?

> "Language is humanity's most powerful tool. NLP gives machines access to that power."

Natural language processing bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding. This demo helps you explore how computers break down and analyze text - the building blocks of modern AI systems like chatbots, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/interactive-nlp-demo.git
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   bash main.sh
   ```

## 📋 Usage

1. Enter text or upload a file
2. Select preprocessing options:
   - Tokenization
   - Stop Word Removal
   - Stemming
   - Lemmatization
3. View the processed results and visual analysis

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Streamlit**: Interactive web application
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
- **spaCy**: Industrial-strength NLP
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations

## 🤔 Thought Experiments

- How might different preprocessing steps affect sentiment analysis accuracy?
- Could customized stop word lists improve results for domain-specific text?
- What are the trade-offs between stemming and lemmatization in different languages?

## 🔮 Future Directions

- Named Entity Recognition
- Sentiment Analysis
- Language Detection
- Topic Modeling
- Custom Model Integration
